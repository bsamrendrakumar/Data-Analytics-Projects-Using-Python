# Health Monitoring and Analysis using Python Projects

import pandas as pd
health_data = pd.read_csv("C:\\Users\\AMRENDRA KUM AR\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\CSV Datas\\healthmonitoring.csv")
print(health_data.head())

# Let’s have a look at whether the data contains any null values or not:
health_data.isnull().sum()

# So, the data contains null values in body temperature and oxygen saturation columns. For simplicity, I’ll fill the null values using the median value:
# calculate medians
median_body_temp = health_data['BodyTemperature'].median()
median_oxygen_sat = health_data['OxygenSaturation'].median()
# fill missing values
health_data['BodyTemperature'].fillna(median_body_temp, inplace=True)
health_data['OxygenSaturation'].fillna(median_oxygen_sat, inplace=True)

# Next, we will examine summary statistics and the distribution of the numerical health metrics (Age, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, Body Temperature, and Oxygen Saturation). It will help us understand the typical values and the spread of the data. I’ll also include some visualizations to better understand these distributions:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# summary statistics
summary_stats = health_data.describe()

# plotting distributions of numerical features
fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 2, figsize=(14, 18))
sns.histplot(health_data['Age'], bins=20, kde=True, ax=axes[0, 0])
axes[0, 0].set_title('Age Distribution')

sns.histplot(health_data['HeartRate'], bins=20, kde=True, ax=axes[0, 1])
axes[0, 1].set_title('Heart Rate Distribution')

sns.histplot(health_data['RespiratoryRate'], bins=20, kde=True, ax=axes[1, 0])
axes[1, 0].set_title('Respiratory Rate Distribution')

sns.histplot(health_data['BodyTemperature'], bins=20, kde=True, ax=axes[1, 1])
axes[1, 1].set_title('Body Temperature Distribution')

sns.histplot(health_data['OxygenSaturation'], bins=10, kde=True, ax=axes[2, 0])
axes[2, 0].set_title('Oxygen Saturation Distribution')

fig.delaxes(axes[2,1])  # remove unused subplot

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print(summary_stats)

# Now, let’s have a look at the gender distribution in the data and the correlation between the numerical columns in the dataset
# gender Distribution
gender_counts = health_data['Gender'].value_counts()

# correlation Matrix for numerical health metrics
correlation_matrix = health_data[['Age', 'HeartRate', 'RespiratoryRate', 'BodyTemperature', 'OxygenSaturation']].corr()

# plotting the findings
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 6))

# gender distribution plot
gender_counts.plot(kind='pie', ax=axes[0], autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90, colors=['#ff9999','#66b3ff'])
axes[0].set_ylabel('')
axes[0].set_title('Gender Distribution')

# correlation matrix plot
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, fmt=".2f", cmap='coolwarm', ax=axes[1])
axes[1].set_title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
'''The pie chart indicates a nearly even split between male and female subjects in the dataset, with males comprising a slight majority at 51.2%. The correlation matrix shows no strong correlations between the variables, as all the values are close to zero. Specifically, none of the health metrics (Age, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, Body Temperature, and Oxygen Saturation) display a strong positive or negative linear relationship with one another in this particular dataset. It suggests that,
for this group of individuals, changes in one metric are not strongly associated with changes in the others.'''

# Now, let’s have a look at the heart rate by activity level
# heart Rate by activity level
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='ActivityLevel', y='HeartRate', data=health_data)
plt.title('Heart Rate by Activity Level')
plt.ylabel('Heart Rate (beats per minute)')
plt.xlabel('Activity Level')
plt.show()
'''It shows that the median heart rate increases from resting to walking, which is expected as physical activity increases. However, the median heart rate does not significantly increase further during running compared to walking, which is unusual since we would expect a higher median heart rate for a more strenuous activity. Additionally, there is considerable overlap in the interquartile ranges between walking and running, suggesting similar variability in heart rates for these activities within the sampled population. 
The presence of outliers in the resting category indicates that some individuals have resting heart rates that are much higher than the typical range for the rest of the group.'''

# Now, let’s have a look at the distribution of blood pressure levels and some health metrics by gender:
# extracting systolic and diastolic blood pressure for analysis
health_data[['SystolicBP', 'DiastolicBP']] = health_data['BloodPressure'].str.split('/', expand=True).astype(int)
# blood pressure distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.histplot(health_data['SystolicBP'], color="skyblue", label="Systolic", kde=True)
sns.histplot(health_data['DiastolicBP'], color="red", label="Diastolic", kde=True)
plt.title('Blood Pressure Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Blood Pressure (mmHg)')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
# health metrics by gender
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='Gender', y='HeartRate', data=health_data, ax=axes[0])
axes[0].set_title('Heart Rate by Gender')
axes[0].set_xlabel('Gender')
axes[0].set_ylabel('Heart Rate (beats per minute)')
sns.boxplot(x='Gender', y='OxygenSaturation', data=health_data, ax=axes[1])
axes[1].set_title('Oxygen Saturation by Gender')
axes[1].set_xlabel('Gender')
axes[1].set_ylabel('Oxygen Saturation (%)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
'''The systolic blood pressure, represented in blue, shows a more spread-out distribution with peaks suggesting common readings around 120 mmHg and 140 mmHg. The diastolic blood pressure, in red, appears to have a narrower distribution, with a significant peak around 80 mmHg. The spread of systolic values is broader than the diastolic ones, which is typical as systolic pressure tends to vary more with factors like activity level and stress. This distribution is consistent with general population trends where a systolic reading of around 120 mmHg and a diastolic reading of around 80 mmHg are considered normal.

For heart rate, both males and females show similar median values with a relatively similar interquartile range, indicating no significant difference in heart rate between genders within this dataset. In terms of oxygen saturation, again, both genders exhibit nearly identical medians and interquartile ranges, suggesting that oxygen saturation does not differ notably between males and females in this sample. There are a few outliers in oxygen saturation for both genders, indicating a few individuals with lower than typical values, but these do not seem to affect the overall distribution significantly
