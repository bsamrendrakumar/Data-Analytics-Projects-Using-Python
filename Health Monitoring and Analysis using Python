# Health Monitoring and Analysis using Python Projects

import pandas as pd

# Let’s have a look at whether the data contains any null values or not:
health_data.isnull().sum()

# So, the data contains null values in body temperature and oxygen saturation columns. For simplicity, I’ll fill the null values using the median value:
# calculate medians
median_body_temp = health_data['BodyTemperature'].median()
median_oxygen_sat = health_data['OxygenSaturation'].median()
# fill missing values
health_data['BodyTemperature'].fillna(median_body_temp, inplace=True)
health_data['OxygenSaturation'].fillna(median_oxygen_sat, inplace=True)

# Next, we will examine summary statistics and the distribution of the numerical health metrics (Age, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, Body Temperature, and Oxygen Saturation). It will help us understand the typical values and the spread of the data. I’ll also include some visualizations to better understand these distributions:

# Now, let’s have a look at the gender distribution in the data and the correlation between the numerical columns in the dataset
# gender Distribution

'''The pie chart indicates a nearly even split between male and female subjects in the dataset, with males comprising a slight majority at 51.2%. The correlation matrix shows no strong correlations between the variables, as all the values are close to zero. Specifically, none of the health metrics (Age, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, Body Temperature, and Oxygen Saturation) display a strong positive or negative linear relationship with one another in this particular dataset. It suggests that,
for this group of individuals, changes in one metric are not strongly associated with changes in the others.'''

# Now, let’s have a look at the heart rate by activity level
# heart Rate by activity level

'''It shows that the median heart rate increases from resting to walking, which is expected as physical activity increases. However, the median heart rate does not significantly increase further during running compared to walking, which is unusual since we would expect a higher median heart rate for a more strenuous activity. Additionally, there is considerable overlap in the interquartile ranges between walking and running, suggesting similar variability in heart rates for these activities within the sampled population. 
The presence of outliers in the resting category indicates that some individuals have resting heart rates that are much higher than the typical range for the rest of the group.'''

# Now, let’s have a look at the distribution of blood pressure levels and some health metrics by gender:
# extracting systolic and diastolic blood pressure for analysis

# blood pressure distribution

# health metrics by gender

sns.boxplot(x='Gender', y='OxygenSaturation', data=health_data, ax=axes[1])

'''The systolic blood pressure, represented in blue, shows a more spread-out distribution with peaks suggesting common readings around 120 mmHg and 140 mmHg. 
The diastolic blood pressure, in red, appears to have a narrower distribution, with a significant peak around 80 mmHg. The spread of systolic values is broader than the 
diastolic ones, which is typical as systolic pressure tends to vary more with factors like activity level and stress. This distribution is consistent with general population
trends where a systolic reading of around 120 mmHg and a diastolic reading of around 80 mmHg are considered normal.
For heart rate, both males and females show similar median values with a relatively similar interquartile range, indicating no significant difference in heart rate between genders
within this dataset. In terms of oxygen saturation, again, both genders exhibit nearly identical medians and interquartile ranges, suggesting that oxygen saturation does not differ
notably between males and females in this sample. There are a few outliers in oxygen saturation for both genders, indicating a few individuals with lower than typical values,
but these do not seem to affect the overall distribution significantly'''

# Now, let’s analyze heart rate and oxygen saturation by sleep quality and stress levels:
# categorizing sleep quality and stress level for better analysis
sleep_quality_order = ['excellent', 'good', 'fair', 'poor']
stress_level_order = ['low', 'moderate', 'high']
# creating plots to examine relationships
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(16, 12))

axes[0, 1].set_ylabel('Heart Rate (beats per minute)')
# oxygen saturation by sleep quality
sns.boxplot(x='SleepQuality', y='OxygenSaturation', data=health_data, order=sleep_quality_order, ax=axes[1, 0])

plt.show()
'''Heart rate appears relatively consistent across different levels of sleep quality and stress, with a slight increase in variation for those reporting poor sleep. Oxygen saturation shows a minimal decrease in median values from excellent to poor sleep quality, with some outliers indicating lower saturation for excellent and good sleep. When correlated with stress levels, oxygen saturation remains largely unchanged. Overall, while there are outliers, the central tendencies suggest that neither heart rate nor oxygen saturation is greatly affected by sleep quality or stress level
within this dataset.'''

# Now, let’s analyze the respiratory rate and body temperature by activity levels:
# creating plots to examine relationships between activity level and other health metrics
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 6))
# respiratory rate by activity level
sns.boxplot(x='ActivityLevel', y='RespiratoryRate', data=health_data, ax=axes[0])

axes[1].set_ylabel('Body Temperature (°F)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
'''The respiratory rate tends to increase with activity level, as indicated by higher median rates for walking and running compared to resting. 
It aligns with physiological responses to exercise, where the breathing rate increases to meet oxygen demands. For body temperature, there is a slight upward trend from 
resting to running, which is consistent with the body heating up during physical exertion. There are outliers in body temperature at the resting and running levels, 
suggesting some individuals have temperatures outside the typical range for these activities. Overall, the trends observed are in line with expected physiological responses to 
varying levels of activity.'''

# Grouping Patients
